## [Marketing Expenses Research](https://github.com/adnankan01/Adnans_Portfolio/blob/main/BusinessDecisionsOnDataProject.ipynb)<a id='marketing'></a>
 
 For this project I've analysed data on marketing costs, visits and orders for Yandex.Afisha:
 * Described how clients used the product and when they made purchases
 * Calculated retention rates
 * Performed cohort analysis
 * Explained which marketing costs were worthwhile
 * Came up with product and marketing campaign improvements
 
**Key words**: LTV, CAC, ROMI, retention, cohort analysis. 
**Libraries used**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.

## [Mobile app conversion]()<a id='mobile'></a>
 
 In this project I've analysed mobile app logs:
 * Determined how many logs are there per each date, chose a suitable date interval for analysis
 * Created event funnel to understand when users leave the app
 * Developed recommendations on conversion improvement
 * Checked whether new design was beneficial using the results of A/A/B test
 
**Key words**: sales funnel, conversion, A/B test, user behaviour. 
**Libraries used**: pandas, plotly, seaborn, scipy.
