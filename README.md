# Jupyter notebook<a id='jn'></a>

## [Marketing Expenses Research](https://github.com/adnankan01/Adnans_Portfolio/tree/main/BusAnalyticsProject)<a id='marketing'></a>
 
 For this project I've analysed data on marketing costs, visits and orders for Yandex.Afisha:
 * Described how clients used the product and when they made purchases
 * Calculated retention rates
 * Performed cohort analysis
 * Explained which marketing costs were worthwhile
 * Came up with product and marketing campaign improvements
 
**Key words**: LTV, CAC, ROMI, retention, cohort analysis. 

**Libraries used**: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy.

## [Online store A/B testing]()<a id='online_store'></a>
 
 In this project I've worked with online store orders and visits:
 * Prioritised list of hypotheses to test using ICE and RICE scores
 * Analysed results of A/B test: compared cumulative revenue, order size, conversion rate for each group
 * Detected anomalies in data
 * Checked whether there was statistical significance between groups using data with and without anomalies
 * Provided recommendations whether to stop or continue A/B test
 
**Key words**: hypotheses prioritization, hypotheses testing, A/B testing

**Libraries used**: pandas, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn

## [Food market research]()<a id='food'></a>
 
 Here I've worked with data on food market in LA to provide recommendations to investors:
 * Counted various establishment types
 * Found dependencies between type of establishment and belonging to a chain
 * Visualised number of seats distribution
 * Investigated LA streets with a lot of restaurants
 * Described strategies for successful restaurant opening
 
**Key words**: pie chart, bar plot, scatter plot, distribution plot. 

**Libraries used**: pandas, matplotlib, numpy, plotly, seaborn.

## [Mobile app conversion]
()
<a id='mobile'></a>
 
 In this project I've analysed mobile app logs:
 * Determined how many logs are there per each date, chose a suitable date interval for analysis
 * Created event funnel to understand when users leave the app
 * Developed recommendations on conversion improvement
 * Checked whether new design was beneficial using the results of A/A/B test
 
**Key words**: sales funnel, conversion, A/B test, user behaviour. 

**Libraries used**: pandas, plotly, seaborn, scipy.
